## Abstract 
In this paper we formulate, test and estimate a structural model of household division. Our model is based on the recent primarily theoretical literature on the collective household. Gains from co-residence arise from cost-sharing a household-specific public good and lower barriers to information sharing on best-practice farming techniques, but whether such gains are sufficient to make co-residence desirable depends on the existence of scale economies or diseconomies in production and on how household structure affects risk diversification and risk-sharing. The model yields implications for how household size and intrahousehold inequality interact with exogenous income growth to affect: (i) the amount of the household public good that is consumed, (ii) which households divide, (iii) the exact divisions of the assets among the new households and (iv) the evolution of the incomes of the new configurations of households.

The implications of the model are tested using panel data describing Indian farm households starting from the onset of the Indian "green revolution" in the late 1960's through 1982. We find for example that, as predicted by the model, within-household inequality in schooling, marriages, and riskiness increase the probability of household division.

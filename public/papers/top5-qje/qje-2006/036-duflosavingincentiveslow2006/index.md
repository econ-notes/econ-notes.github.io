# Saving Incentives for Low- And Middle-Income Families: Evidence From a Field Experiment With H&R Block


## Abstract 
We analyze a randomized experiment in which 14,000 tax filers in H\&R Block offices in St. Louis received matches of zero, 20 percent, or 50 percent of IRA contributions. Take-up rates were 3 percent, 8 percent, and 14 percent, respectively. Among contributors, contributions, excluding the match, averaged \$765 in the control group and \$1100 in the match groups. Taxpayer responses to similar incentives in the Saver's Credit are much smaller. Taxpayers did not game the experiment by receiving a match and strategically withdrawing funds. Tax professionals significantly influenced contribution choices. These results suggest that both incentives and information affect behavior.

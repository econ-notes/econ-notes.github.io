## Abstract 
Human subjects decide when to sink a fixed cost $C$ to seize an irreversible investment opportunity whose value $V$ is governed by Brownian motion. The optimal policy is to invest when $V$ first crosses a threshold $V^* = (1 + w^*) C$, where the wait option premium $w^*$ depends on drift, volatility, and expiration  hazard parameters. Subjects in the Low $w^*$ treatment on average invest at values quite close to optimum.  Subjects in the two Medium and the High $w^*$ treatments invested at values below optimum, but with the predicted ordering, and values approached the optimum by the last block of 20 periods.

## Abstract 
This paper presents a test for exogeneity of explanatory variables that minimizes the need for auxiliary assumptions that are not required by the definition of exogeneity. It concerns inference about a non-parametric function $g$ that is identified by a conditional moment restriction involving instrumental variables (IV). A test of the hypothesis that $g$ is the mean of a random variable $Y$ conditional on a covariate $X$ is developed that is not subject to the ill-posed inverse problem of non-parametric IV estimation. The test is consistent whenever $g$ differs from $E(Y \mid X)$ on a set of non-zero probability. The usefulness of this new exogeneity test is displayed through Monte Carlo experiments and an application to estimation of non-parametric consumer expansion paths.

## Abstract 
We analyse a model of equilibrium directed search in a large labour market. Each worker, observing the wages posted at all vacancies, makes a fixed, finite number of applications, $a$. We allow for the possibility of ex post competition should more than one vacancy want to hire the same worker. For each $a$, there is a unique symmetric equilibrium in which all vacancies post the same wage. When $a = 1$, the common posted wage lies between the competitive and monopsony levels, and equilibrium is efficient. When $a > 1$, all vacancies post the monopsony wage. Some workers fail to find a job, some find a job at the monopsony wage, and some -- those for whom there is competition -- get the competitive wage. Equilibrium is inefficient when $a > 1$; in particular, there is excessive vacancy creation.

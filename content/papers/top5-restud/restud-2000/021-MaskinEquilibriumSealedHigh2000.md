## Abstract 
There is a voluminous theoretical literature on sealed high-bid auctions (auctions in which bids are sealed and the high bidder pays his bid). A critical property on which this literature relies is the existence of equilibrium in which buyers' bidding strategies are monotonic in their types. This enables the analyst to perform comparative statics as the distribution of types changes, and to compare the welfare properties of the high-bid auction with those of other auction institutions.

One case in which the existence of monotonic equilibrium is readily established is that in which buyers' types are distributed smoothly, independently and symmetrically. In this case, there exists a symmetric equilibrium -- one in which all bidders share the same bidding behaviour as a function of their valuations -- and this bid function is the solution to a first-order differential equation.

However, many applications require consideration of asymmetric distributions, common values, or discrete distributions. For these cases the issue of equilibrium existence is not as straightforward. Indeed, even in apparently simple cases, monotonic equilibrium may fail to exist. Therefore we attempt here to provide sufficient conditions that are general enough to cover most applications that the literature has considered.

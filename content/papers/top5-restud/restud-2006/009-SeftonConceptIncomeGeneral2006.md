## Abstract 
This paper derives a concept of aggregate real income for a competitive economy in general equilibrium consisting of heterogeneous infinitely lived people and relates it to current and future consumption possibilities. An important characteristic of our measure of income, which we call Real Income, is that deflation is carried out using a consumption deflator rather than any price index of output. We suggest that it may be inappropriate to regard capital gains as income. We also present a coherent treatment of the effects of changes to the terms of trade on Real Income and explain the implications of this for resourceexporting economies.

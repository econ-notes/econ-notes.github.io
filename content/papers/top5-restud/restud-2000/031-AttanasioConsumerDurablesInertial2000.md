## Abstract 
In this paper, I model the purchase behaviour of automobiles by U.S. households as an $(S, s)$ rule. I estimate a flexible specification of such a rule using a large microeconomic data set and study some of the aggregate implications of this type of inertial behaviour.

I define the $(S, s)$ rule in terms of the ratio of the value of the stock of automobiles to non-durable consumption. In other words, non-durable consumption, which is unlikely to be affected by adjustment costs, proxies for the marginal utility of wealth in the equilibrium equation which defines the desired level of the stock of durables. The $(S, s)$ rule is then interpreted in terms of deviations from such a specification. I propose a very flexible specification of the rule that allows for both observed and unobserved heterogeneity in target values and band widths. While I cannot prove that my model is necessarily optimal, the stochastic specification I use is flexible enough that could conceivably encompass a large class of models. Having estimated the parameters of the $(S, s)$ rule, the aim of the second part of the paper is to establish the consequences of inertial behaviour for aggregate expenditure on automobiles.

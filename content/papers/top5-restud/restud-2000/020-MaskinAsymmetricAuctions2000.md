## Abstract 
The revenue-equivalence theorem for auctions predicts that expected seller revenue is independent of the bidding rules, as long as equilibrium has the properties that the buyer with the highest reservation price wins and any buyer with the lowest possible reservation price has zero expected surplus. This strong prediction of equivalence seems at odds, however, with the empirical observation that rarely is any given kind of commodity sold through more than one sort of auction.

The hypotheses of the revenue-equivalence theorem may be too strong. The principal assumptions are (i) risk neutrality, (ii) independence of different buyers' private signals about the item's value, (iii) lack of collusion among buyers, and (iv) symmetry of buyers' beliefs. In all previous papers, buyers are symmetric ex ante in the sense that their preference parameters (i.e. their "types") are drawn from a symmetric joint probability distribution. Thus if two buyers are of the same type they will have the same beliefs about the remaining buyers' preferences. Given this symmetry, there will exist a symmetric equilibrium (if an equilibrium exists at all.)

In this paper we drop the symmetry assumption. In the following section we describe the basic model and then present three illustrative examples. These show that, with asymmetry, revenue equivalence no longer holds and that, under different assumptions about the nature of the heterogeneity, expected revenue in the high-bid auction may be higher or lower than in the open auction.

# Equilibrium in Justifiable Strategies: A Model of Reason-Based Choice in Extensive-Form Games


## Abstract 
I explore the idea that people care about the justifiability of their decisions in the context of two-person extensive games. Each player justifies his strategy $s$ with a belief $b$ of the opponent's strategy, which is consistent with the play path and maximally plausible (according to some exogenous criterion). We say that $s$ is justifiable if against the ex post criticism that some other strategy $s^{\prime}$ outperforms $s$ against $b$, the player can argue that playing $s^{\prime}$ would have exposed him to similar criticism in the opposite direction. Under a simplicity-based plausibility criterion, this concept implies systematic departures from maximizing behaviour in familiar games.

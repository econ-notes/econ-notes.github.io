# Partial Identification in Monotone Binary Models: Discrete Regressors and Interval Data


## Abstract 
We investigate identification in semi-parametric binary regression models, $y = 1(x \beta + v + \varepsilon > 0)$ when $v$ is either discrete or measured within intervals. The error term $\varepsilon$ is assumed to be uncorrelated with a set of instruments $z$, $\varepsilon$ is independent of $v$ conditionally on $x$ and $z$, and the support of $-(x \beta + \varepsilon)$ is finite. We provide a sharp characterization of the set of observationally equivalent parameters $\beta$. When there are as many instruments $z$ as variables $x$, the bounds of the identified intervals of the different scalar components $\beta_k$ of parameter $\beta$ can be expressed as simple moments of the data. Also, in the case of interval data, we show that additional information on the distribution of $v$ within intervals shrinks the identified set. Specifically, the closer the conditional distribution of $v$ given $z$ is to uniformity, the smaller is the identified set. Point identified is achieved if and only if $v$ is uniform within intervals.

## Abstract 
The prevalence of shirking within a large Italian bank appears to be characterized by significant regional differentials. In particular, absenteeism and misconduct episodes are substantially more prevalent in the south. We consider a number of potential explanations for this fact: different individual backgrounds; group-interaction effects; sorting of workers across regions; differences in local attributes; different hiring policies; and discrimination against southern workers. Our analysis suggests that individual backgrounds, group-interaction effects, and sorting effects contribute to explaining the north-south shirking differential. None of the other explanations appears to be of first-order importance.
